== Google Maps for Rails (gmaps4rails)

Gmaps4rails is developped to simply create a Google Map:

- directly from your model,

- from your own json

It's based on Ruby on Rails 3 Engines and uses Google Maps API V3.

See screencasts here: http://www.youtube.com/user/TheApneadiving


== Requirements
- gem 'gmaps4rails'     (in your gemfile, then bundle)
- <%= yield :head %>    (in your header)
- <%= yield :scripts %> (in your footer)
- config.serve_static_assets = true  (in your production.rb), or run 'rails generate gmaps4rails:install' to copy the JS and CSS assets to your /public folder.

== Basic configuration
In your model, add:

	acts_as_gmappable
	
		def gmaps4rails_address
		  #describe how to retrieve the address from your model, if you use directly a db column, you can dry your code, see wiki
		  "#{self.street}, #{self.city}, #{self.country}" 
		end

Create a migration and add the following fields to your table (here users):

	add_column :users, :latitude, :float #you can change the name, see wiki
	add_column :users, :longitude, :float #you can change the name, see wiki
	add_column :users, :gmaps, :boolean #not mandatory, see wiki

== How to?
=== QuickStart!
In your controller:
 
  @json = User.all.to_gmaps4rails

In your view:

  <%= gmaps4rails(@json) %>

Done!
