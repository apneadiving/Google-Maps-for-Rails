== Google Maps for Rails (gmaps4rails)


Gmaps4rails is developed to simply create a Google Map (Gmaps):

- directly from your model,

- from your own json

It's based on Ruby on Rails 3 Engines and uses Google Maps API V3.

== Installation

	gem install gmaps4rails

== Requirements
- <%= yield :head %> (in your header)
- <%= yield :scripts %> (in your footer)
- config.serve_static_assets = true  (in your production.rb), or copy/paste gmaps4rails.css & gmaps4rail.js files in your app.

== Basic configuration
In your model, add:

	acts_as_gmappable

	def gmaps4rails_address
	  self.address #describe how to retrieve the address from your model
	end

Create a migration and add the following fields to your table (here users):

	add_column :users, :latitude, :float #you can change the name, see wiki
	add_column :users, :longitude, :float #you can change the name, see wiki
	add_column :users, :gmaps, :boolean #not mandatory, see wiki

== How to?
=== QuickStart!
In your controller:
 
  @json = User.all.to_gmaps4rails

In your view:

  <%= gmaps4rails(@json) %>

Done!

== Options

* Markers with Info window, Custom Picture

* Circles, Polylines, Polygons

* Geocode directly your address and retrieve coordinates. 

* Wrapper for 'Direction', giving instructions to go from point A to point B

* Auto-adjust the map to your markers

* Refresh your map on the fly with Javascript (and Ajax)
