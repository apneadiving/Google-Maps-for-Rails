CHANGELOG
=========

March 21, 2012
--------------

Created vendor/assets folder to make assets available for Rails 3 asset pipeline.

Noticed they are already added to pipeline for Rails 3.1+ via:

module Gmaps4rails
	...
  class Engine < Rails::Engine
  	...
       if Rails::VERSION::MAJOR >= 3 && Rails::VERSION::MINOR >= 1
         app.config.assets.paths << "#{root}/public/stylesheets"

But still nice to have them in vendor/assets I think ;)
